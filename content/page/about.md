I am the digital painter. For my works I used mainly Gimp.

I put the subtitle "Gathering Apart Parts" on my page, because I felt that I have sought the images like each part of the painting represents something, gathering apart, as it happens.

E-mail me if you interest in my works; e-mail: mnaka.portable@gmail.com
