I am a digital painter. For my works I used mainly Gimp.

I put the subtitle "Gathering Apart Parts" on my page, because I felt that I seek the images like each part of the painting happens to gather apart with representing something.

E-mail me if you interest in my works; e-mail: mnaka.portable@gmail.com
